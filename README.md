<h1>FOR VSCODE USERS:</h1>

You can now use the built in "run and debug" feature with this repo

When you clone the repo, simply just click run and debug, and choose "Client/Server" at the top then press play

it installs dependancies for you and then starts the server and client with debugging features

(You still need a .env file for local copies though)
